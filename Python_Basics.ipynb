        "**THEORY QUESTIONS**\n",
        "\n",
        "1.   What is Python, and why is it popular?\n",
        "Answer - Python is a programming language that's popular because it's easy to learn, versatile, and has many libraries. It's used for many applications, including web development, data science, and machine learning.\n",
        "Why Python is popular?\n",
        "Easy to learn: Python has a simple syntax that's accessible to beginners.\n",
        "Versatile: Python can be used to create many different types of programs.\n",
        "Large libraries: Python has many libraries and frameworks that can save time and effort.\n",
        "Cross-platform: Python can run on many different platforms.\n",
        "Supported by big companies: Companies like Google, Netflix, Uber, and Dropbox use Python.\n",
        "Used in many fields: Python is used in web development, data science, machine learning, scientific computing, and more.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.    What is an interpreter in Python*\n",
        "Answer - A Python interpreter is a program that directly executes Python code line-by-line, translating each instruction into machine code that the computer can understand, allowing you to run Python code without needing to first compile it into an executable file; essentially, it acts as a translator between your Python code and the computer's hardware.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.   What are predefined keywords in Python?\n",
        "Answer - Predefined keywords in Python are words that have a specific meaning and are reserved for use in Python programs. They cannot be used as variable names.\n",
        "Examples of Python keywords\n",
        "True: A keyword that represents the value true\n",
        "False: A keyword that represents the value false\n",
        "None: A keyword that represents the value none\n",
        "And: A keyword that represents the logical operator \"and\"\n",
        "As: A keyword that can be used in Python programs\n",
        "Assert: A keyword that can be used in Python programs\n",
        "Async: A keyword that can be used in Python programs\n",
        "Elif: Short for \"else if\", this keyword is used when the first if statement is not true\n",
        "If: A keyword that can be used in Python programs\n",
        "Else: A keyword that can be used in Python programs\n",
        "Except: A keyword that can be used in Python programs\n",
        "Pass: A keyword that can be used in Python programs\n",
        "Break: A keyword that can be used in Python programs\n",
        "\n",
        "4.   Can keywords be used as variable names*\n",
        "Answer - No, keywords cannot be used as variable names because they have special meanings and purposes in a programming language. Keywords are also known as reserved words.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.   What is mutability in Python*\n",
        "Answer - In Python, mutability is the ability of an object to change after it has been created. Mutable objects can be modified in terms of their state or contents.\n",
        "Examples of mutable objects\n",
        "Lists\n",
        "You can add, remove, or change elements in a list. For example, you can use the append() method to add an element to the end of a list.\n",
        "Dictionaries\n",
        "You can add key-value pairs to a dictionary. For example, you can use the my_dict[4] = 'guava' statement to add a new key-value pair to a dictionary.\n",
        "\n",
        "6.   Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        "Answer - Tuples and lists are the same in every way except two: tuples use parentheses instead of square brackets, and the items in tuples cannot be modified (but the items in lists can be modified). We often call lists mutable (meaning they can be changed) and tuples immutable (meaning they cannot be changed).\n",
        "\n",
        "7.   What is the difference between \"==\" and \"is\" operators in Python?\n",
        "Answer - In Python, the == operator compares the values of two objects, while the is operator compares whether two variables point to the same object.\n",
        "Explanation\n",
        "==\n",
        "The equality operator compares the values of two objects. For example, if you compare two cats with the == operator, you'll get the answer \"both cats are equal\".\n",
        "is\n",
        "The identity operator compares whether two variables point to the same object in memory. For example, if you compare two cats with the is operator, you'll get the answer \"these are two different cats\".\n",
        "\n",
        "8.  What are logical operators in Python*\n",
        "Answer - Logical operators in Python are symbols or words that combine multiple conditions into a single boolean expression. The three types of logical operators in Python are:\n",
        "And: Returns True if both conditions are true, and False otherwise\n",
        "Or: Combines multiple conditions\n",
        "Not: Inverts the truth value of a Boolean expression or object\n",
        "\n",
        "9.   What is type casting in Python*\n",
        "Answer - Type casting, also known as type conversion, is the process of changing a variable's data type to another data type in Python. It's a useful feature for making Python code more versatile and ensuring compatibility between different data types.\n",
        "\n",
        "10.   What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
        "Answer - Implicit\n",
        "Python automatically converts one data type to another without the programmer's instruction. This usually happens when performing operations on mixed data types.\n",
        "Explicit\n",
        "The programmer explicitly converts one data type to another using functions or methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "11.  What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
        "Answer - Conditional statements in Python control the flow of a program by deciding which parts of the code to run based on certain conditions. They help make programs more efficient and easier to read.\n",
        "How they work\n",
        "Conditional statements evaluate a condition\n",
        "If the condition is true, the code block associated with that condition is executed\n",
        "If the condition is false, the code block is not executed\n",
        "\n",
        "12.  How does the elif statement work*\n",
        "Answer - The “elif” keyword in Python, stands for “else if”. It can be used in conditional statements to check for multiple conditions. For example, if the first condition is false, it moves on to the next “elif” statement to check if that condition is true.\n",
        "\n",
        "13.     What is the difference between for and while loops*\n",
        "Answer - The main difference between a for loop and a while loop is the number of times the code is repeated. A for loop is used when the number of iterations is known, while a while loop is used when the number of iterations is unknown.\n",
        "\n",
        "14.     Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n",
        "Answer - Example Scenario:\n",
        "Scenario: You are building a system that repeatedly prompts a user to enter a valid password until they get it right. The number of attempts is not fixed — it could be any number of attempts until the user succeeds.\n",
        "python\n",
        "password = \"correct123\"\n",
        "user_input = \"\"\n",
        "attempts = 0\n",
        "\n",
        "while user_input != password:\n",
        "    user_input = input(\"Enter your password: \")\n",
        "    attempts += 1\n",
        "    if attempts >= 3:\n",
        "        print(\"Too many failed attempts.\")\n",
        "        break\n",
        "\n",
        "print(\"Access granted!\")\n"
